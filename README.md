We used Espressif IoT Development Framework [![alt text](https://readthedocs.org/projects/docs/badge/?version=latest "Documentation Status")](https://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest). ESP-IDF is the official development framework for the [ESP32](https://espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview) chip.

We developed a framework based on __C# front-end interface__ and __NOSQL databases__ for information storage. SoC development is based on __C__/__C++__ languages.
